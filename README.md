# ubercart-to-opencart-migration

I recently had a client that wanted to migrate their Ubercart ecommerce site to Opencart. I wrote this app to handle the migration of the following:

1. Existing customers
2. Store options (e.g. Size, Colour)
3. Products
4. Vocabulary/Categories
5. Products to categories
6. Orders
7. Setting up basic SEO urls
8. Product Images

Thought I would upload to Github incase anyone wanted to use it. We were migrating from Ubercart version 6.x-2.14 to Opencart version 2.0.1.1 so there may be some changes needed to make it work with other versions.

#Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run 'npm install' to fetch the required modules
3. Run 'npm start' to start the app, then navigate to the URL you've set it up on.
4. Click the 'Start Migration' button.
